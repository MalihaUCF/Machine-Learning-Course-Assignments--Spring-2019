**Pre-trained convnet Used: VGG-19**

**Dataset Used: Cats and dogs**


The goal of this homework was to learn to leverage pretrained convnets and to use some visualization techniques. We 
experiment with different classifiers placing on top of VGG-19 network ,and tried to maximize the validation accuracy.The solution here shows one of such classifiers as instructed in the assignment.


## Problem 1

Do feature extraction with data augmentation.

We experimented

## Problem 2

Do fine-tuning with data augmentation.

## Problem 3


Visualize heatmaps of class activation for the the model obtained in Problem 2.

## Problem 4

Build an activation model that takes as input an image and produces as output the activation of the last conv layer of the model obtained in Problem 2. Using this activation model obtain the corresponding activations for the validation images. Apply t-SNE visualization to these activations to see how well the convnet separates cats from dogs.
