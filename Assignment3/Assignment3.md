**Pre-trained convnet Used: VGG-19**

**Dataset Used: Cats and dogs**


The goal of this homework was to learn to leverage pretrained convnets and to use some visualization techniques. We 
experiment with different classifiers placing on top of VGG-19 network ,and tried to maximize the validation accuracy.The solution here shows one of such classifiers as instructed in the assignment.


## Problem 1

Do feature extraction with data augmentation.
